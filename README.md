# The Odyssey by Homer

Homer's two epic poems written in 800 BC, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and other Greek writings and myths are central in the definition of Western Cultures. 
As an Asian who is new to the world of western literature, I found it impossible to remember the characters in this masterpiece, and I got so tired of checking the character index every three pages I read. So I decided to start this project, for better understanding of the Odyssey, and the western cultures.
